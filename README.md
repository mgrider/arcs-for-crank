# Arcs for Crank

This is more or less a port of the "arcs" example in the PlaydateSDK (single file examples) to use the crank.

As soon as I saw that example, I wanted to make it work with the crank, and after working with the sdk for a week or so, I found it was easy. I did add some bells and whistles. You can change the number of arcs and invert the drawing from the system menu. Toggle auto-draw with A, and reset the drawing with B.
